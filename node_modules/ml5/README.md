**_This project is currently in development._**

## Friendly machine learning for the web!

ml5.js aims to make machine learning approachable for a broad audience of artists, creative coders, and students. The library provides access to machine learning algorithms and models in the browser, building on top of [TensorFlow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org/) with no other external dependencies.

The library is supported by code examples, tutorials, and sample data sets with an emphasis on ethical computing. Bias in data, stereotypical harms, and responsible crowdsourcing are part of the documentation around data collection and usage.

ml5.js is heavily inspired by [Processing](https://processing.org/) and [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).

## Usage

There are several ways you can use the ml5.js library:

* You can use the latest version (0.2.3) by adding it to the head section of your HTML document:

**v0.2.3**
```javascript
<script src="https://unpkg.com/ml5@0.2.3/dist/ml5.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

* If you need to use an earlier version for any reason, you can change the version number.

**v0.1.3**

```javascript
<script src="https://unpkg.com/ml5@0.1.3/dist/ml5.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

* You can also reference "latest", but we do not recommend this as your code may break as we update ml5.

```javascript
<script src="https://unpkg.com/ml5@latest/dist/ml5.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

* Finally, you can download the [minified](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ml5js/ml5-library/master/dist/ml5.min.js) and include the file:

```javascript
<script src="ml5.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

## Standalone Examples

You can find a collection of standalone examples in this repository: [github.com/ml5js/ml5-examples](https://github.com/ml5js/ml5-examples)

These examples are meant to serve as an introduction to the library and machine learning concepts.
